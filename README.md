With the increasing interest in harvesting wind energy offshore and in urban settings, vertical axis 
wind turbines (VAWTs) have gained renewed attention. Their ability to capture wind from all directions 
makes them particularly appealing for areas with frequently changing wind patterns, such as urban 
environments, while their scalability and low installation costs make them ideal for offshore wind farms. 
However, VAWTs need further performance optimization to compete with horizontal axis wind turbines 
(HAWTs), as they currently exhibit a lower power coefficient (CP). This is largely due to the complex 
flow dynamics around VAWTs and the relatively limited research they have received.
Pitch angle is one parameter that could be used to improve VAWT performance. This study 
investigates the optimization of blade pitch angle in VAWTs using numerical simulations with ANSYS 
Fluent software, solving the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (URANS) while 
turbulence is modeled by a 2-equation k-ε model. The objective is to identify the pitch angle that 
maximizes torque and power performance. A series of simulations were conducted across pitch angles 
ranging from -10° to +7.5°, focusing on specific blade types (NACA 0021, NACA 2421, NACA 4421) 
and tip speed ratios (TSR = 1.78, 120 RPM).
The results demonstrated a 7.6% improvement in CP for the NACA 0021 airfoil at a -5° pitch angle. 
Additionally, the study explored the performance of cambered airfoils, where NACA 2421 and NACA 
4421 showed significant CP gains (6.9% and 4.4%), with optimal pitch angles of -5°
and -2.5°
respectively. These findings provide insights into the potential of pitch angle adjustments to enhance 
VAWT performance, suggesting that symmetrical airfoils with fine-tuned pitch angles could offer 
further efficiency improvements.
Before conducting the simulations to investigate the optimum pitch angle, a comprehensive 
benchmark test was implemented to validate the 2D simulation model. This research contributes to the 
advancement of VAWT design, offering potential pathways such as dynamic pitching and tailored airfoil 
geometries for increasing renewable energy efficiency.
